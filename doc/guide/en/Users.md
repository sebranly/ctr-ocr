# Users

## Introduction

Races are played with human players and optionally CPUs. CPUs mean that the characters are bots. Human players are free to pick their own username so this input field is flexible. However we offer you some suggestions.

## Support

If your player username is not present as a suggestion on the website, you can still type it in. If you want it added as a suggestion, it's possible with a few easy extra steps.
- if you're not too familiar with GitHub, you can just simply leave me a comment by creating a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sebranly/ctr-ocr/issues) :
- if you're more familiar with GitHub, you can open a new Pull Request on the [file of the repository](https://github.com/sebranly/sebranly.github.io/blob/master/json/ctr-ocr/users.json) that contains the JSON object representing human players
  - please note that the repository for this JSON is different from the repository of the website, in order for me to be able to update the list without having to redeploy the website
  - please keep the list alphabetized
